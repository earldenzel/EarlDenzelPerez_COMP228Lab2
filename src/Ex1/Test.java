/*
* Write a Java application that simulates a test.
* The test contains at least five questions about first three lectures of this course.
* Each question should be a multiple-choice question with 4 options.
*
* Design a Test class. Use programmer-defined methods to implement your solution. For example:
* -	create a method to simulate the questions – simulateQuestion
* -	create a method to check the answer – checkAnswer
* -	create a method to display a random message for the user – generateMessage
* -	create a method to interact with the user - inputAnswer
*
* Display the questions using methods of JOptionPane class. Use a loop to show all the questions.
*
* For each question:
* -	If the user finds the right answer, display a random congratulatory message
* (“Excellent!”,”Good!”,”Keep up the good work!”, or “Nice work!”).
* -	If the user responds incorrectly, display an appropriate message and the correct answer
* (“No. Please try again”, “Wrong. Try once more”, “Don't give up!”, “No. Keep trying..”).
* -	Use random-number generation to choose a number from 1 to 4 that will be used to select an appropriate response to each answer.
-	Use a switch statement to issue the responses, as in the following code:
switch ( randomObject.nextInt( 4 ) )
{
case 0:
return( "Very good!" );
……
}
* At the end of the test display the number of correct and incorrect answers, and the percentage of the correct answers.
* Your main driver class will simply create a Test object and start the test by calling startTest method.
